# The Joy Club Coding Guidelines

Coding guidelines for The Joy Club, loosely based on the [Airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

Eventually most of the scenarios listed in here should be covered by linters.

Disagree with a guideline?  Or want to amend or remove an existing one?  Open a PR and start a discussion with your colleagues.
